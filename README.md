# Tools Interface

This rust crate implements structs to easily interface with several Wikipedia/Wikidata/Wikimedia tools and APIs.

## Supported tools

- PagePile (read only)
- Pageviews API
- Persondata Template
- PetScan
- Quarry (existing results only)
- QuickStatements (start batches)

If you would like to see other tools supported, add a request to the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/magnusmanske/tools_interface/issues).
